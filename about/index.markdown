My background is a mix of data science, applied mathematics, and aerospace engineering. In graduate school, I studied computational fluid dynamics, optimal control theory, and dynamical systems theory. I am currently a data scientist at [Uptake](http://uptake.com/), a rapidly growing software startup in Chicago. I write software and build machine learning models to predict failures on industrial assets. 

This blog documents some of my adventures in programming, technology, engineering, and data science.
