I am an aspiring data scientist. I am currently a fellow in a data science fellowship in San Francisco.

Before my pivot into data science, I was a mechanical and aerospace engineering graduate student studying fluid mechanics, control theory, and dynamical systems theory. I spent three years in a Ph.D. program at Caltech, where I conducted research in state estimation for fluid flows using computational fluid dynamics. 

The purpose of this blog is to document some of my adventures in programming, technology, engineering, and data science.
